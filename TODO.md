# Starry Background Component Implementation

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Create `src/components/StarryBackground.tsx` - Reusable React component with random tiny white stars, absolute positioning, and subtle twinkling animation.
- [x] Add CSS keyframes for twinkling effect in `src/index.css`.
- [x] Integrate `StarryBackground` into Projects section in `src/App.tsx`.
- [x] Integrate `StarryBackground` into Education section in `src/components/EducationTimeline.tsx`.

## Followup Steps
- [ ] Test the component in both sections to ensure stars are behind content and text remains readable.
- [ ] Verify performance; adjust star count (currently 50) if needed for better performance.
- [ ] Check responsiveness and ensure stars don't interfere with mobile layouts.
